## Task6 : An elementary steps towards understanding Neural Networks
A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain. 
# Types of Neural networks:
1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):
  Artificial Neural Networks, also known as feedforward neural networks, are the foundation of many machine learning tasks. They consist of an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.
  Mathematical Implication:Each neuron in an ANN performs a weighted sum of its inputs, followed by the application of an activation function. The weighted sum is represented as: 
    z = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wn*xn + b 
   where w represents weights, x represents inputs, and b is the bias term. The result is then passed through an activation function, like the sigmoid or ReLU function, to introduce non-linearity.

2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):
They are tailored for image-related tasks. They include convolutional layers to automatically learn features from images.
Mathematical Implication: CNNs employ convolution operations, which involve sliding a filter (also known as a kernel) over the input image and computing element-wise multiplications and summations. This process captures local patterns in the data.

3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):
They are designed for sequential data, such as time series or natural language processing tasks. They have connections that loop back on themselves.
Mathematical Implication:RNNs maintain a hidden state that represents information from previous time steps. The mathematical implication involves recurrent connections that allow information to flow from one time step to the next, making them capable of handling sequences.

4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:
    LSTMs are a specialized form of RNNs that address the vanishing gradient problem. They are well-suited for tasks requiring the modeling of long-range dependencies.
  Mathematical Implication: LSTMs introduce gating mechanisms that control the flow of information through the network. These gates are governed by sigmoid and tanh functions, making LSTMs capable of capturing long-term dependencies.

5. Mathematical Implications Across Types:
   - All neural networks rely on gradient descent optimization algorithms to adjust weights and biases during training. The mathematical implications involve calculating gradients and updating parameters to minimize a cost function (e.g., mean squared error for regression, cross-entropy for classification).

Neural networks have revolutionized various fields, from image recognition to natural language processing. Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of different neural network types is essential for effectively designing and training these models. It enables the development of sophisticated AI systems that can learn from data and make intelligent decisions.
